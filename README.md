## PUI89 product maturity snapshot — 7 November 2026

**Strategic direction: From AI Projects to AI Products.**  
**Current maturity: Grade 2 — Early Engineering Foundation.** This repository contains research documentation and an initial software-only contract/safety prototype. It is not a functioning or road-tested vehicle.

| Area | Verified position |
|---|---|
| Product definition | Human-driver-first AI vehicle intelligence concept with EasyRide priorities for safety, comfort, inclusive usability and practical cargo storage. |
| Software and AI | Initial contracts/safety logic, tests and opt-in Hugging Face adapter code are documented. Model inference and vehicle-specific accuracy are not yet tested; local contract types still require alignment with the canonical shared PUI89 AI Core. |
| Simulation | Simulation-first research direction; no validated road, vehicle-dynamics or autonomous-driving performance is established. |
| Physical product | No functioning car, verified sensor layout, production CAD/BOM, vehicle integration, roadworthiness or certified safety system is claimed. |

**Next product gate:** align the software contracts with the shared AI Core; define driver-assistance use cases, hazards, data quality and human-control boundaries; build deterministic synthetic scenarios and reproducible evaluations. In parallel, convert EasyRide comfort, accessibility and cargo goals into measurable user and packaging requirements.

**Product discipline:** AI remains advisory; the human driver retains control. No autonomous-driving, road-safety, waterproofing, fire-resistance or production-readiness claims are made. No paid API, cloud GPU, automatic model download or physical vehicle actuation is part of this update.



![PUI89 AI Car — Vehicle Intelligence Concept](docs/images/pui89-ai-car-concept.svg)

**Repository:** `Pui89/ai-robot-car`  
**Project type:** Advanced AI-enabled vehicle intelligence and robotics research; software-first, simulation-first.  
**Status:** Early-stage software scaffold. Not a built, road-tested, autonomous, or road-certified vehicle.

## Design concept

The concept uses a premium electric crossover form in PUI89 deep navy and electric cyan. The illustrative sensor layout communicates a future perception envelope (camera, radar, lidar and proximity sensing), while the software architecture remains human-driver-first: AI produces evidence-linked advisories, not steering, throttle or braking commands.

**The artwork is a design visualization, not a production CAD model, bill of materials, verified sensor layout, built prototype, or performance claim.** Sensor selection and physical packaging remain future engineering work.

## EasyRide: inclusive, comfortable and practical mobility

PUI89 AI Car adopts **EasyRide** as a human-centred design direction: make everyday driving easier, more comfortable and more supportive for as many people as possible. The concept is intended to consider women, older adults, new and less-confident drivers, families, and people with different body sizes, strengths and accessibility needs.

- **Safety-first experience:** clear visibility, understandable warnings, conservative driver assistance, intuitive controls and reduced distraction are design priorities. Safety performance must be demonstrated through engineering analysis and testing; it is not yet validated.
- **Comfortable, gentle ride:** investigate supportive seating, easy entry and exit, accessible reach, smooth ride characteristics, low-effort controls, climate comfort and a quiet cabin. These are design targets, not verified vehicle features.
- **Useful, generous storage:** plan practical luggage and cargo space inside the vehicle for everyday shopping, travel bags, mobility-related items and larger bulky belongings. Storage must be designed around safe load limits, secure restraint, visibility and passenger protection; cargo must never obstruct controls, airbags, exits or the driver's view.
- **Helpful AI assistance:** explore clear route and hazard information, parking support, vehicle-health alerts, trip preparation and simple explanations. AI should reduce workload without distracting the driver or taking control away from the human.
- **Inclusive usability:** evaluate adjustable seating and steering reach, easy-to-read displays, simple interaction, helpful voice/interface options and accessible entry/exit. Avoid assuming that one body type, age group or level of driving experience represents everyone.
- **Human control and fallback:** the driver remains responsible for driving. Assistance must communicate uncertainty, allow the driver to ignore or dismiss non-critical suggestions, and fail safely when information is missing or unreliable.

The goal is a vehicle concept that is **safe by design, comfortable to use, practical to carry everyday and larger items, and genuinely helpful across different users**. These goals require user research, ergonomic assessment, hazard analysis, simulation and qualified vehicle testing before any real-world safety or accessibility claim can be made.

## Mission

Develop a safety-first vehicle intelligence platform for environmental awareness, hazard detection, vehicle-health monitoring, predictive maintenance, and explainable driver assistance. A human driver remains responsible for vehicle control. This repository has no physical vehicle integration or actuator authority.

## PUI89 engineering rules

- **Strict zero-cost:** no paid APIs, subscriptions, cloud GPUs, paid datasets, metered services, or unexpected billing.
- **Simulation first:** no physical vehicle, ECU, vehicle-bus or actuator connections.
- **Safety before features:** uncertainty, human review, conservative failure handling and hazard analysis are mandatory.
- **Evidence before claims:** distinguish proposed, implemented, simulation-tested, bench-tested and independently validated capabilities.
- **Shared AI Core:** reuse canonical PUI89 contracts and services; local compatibility types are temporary and must not become a competing core.
- **Security by default:** least privilege, dependency/provenance review, protected changes and no secrets in source.
- **No unsupported autonomous-driving, roadworthiness, waterproofing, fire-resistance or safety claims.**

## Capability research areas

1. Environmental perception and hazard-awareness research.
2. Human-facing driver-assistance concepts.
3. Vehicle-health and predictive-maintenance research.
4. Road, weather and visibility context using documented lawful data or simulation.
5. Agentic analysis with evidence and human oversight.
6. SHIELD risk monitoring, stale-data handling and conservative degradation.
7. Inclusive human-machine interaction, comfort, ergonomics and practical cargo-use research.

## Working concept architecture

`Observation → WorldState → Hazard Analysis → Safety Gate → Human-facing Advisory → Evidence Record`

- Inputs must preserve source, timestamp, quality, confidence, provenance and freshness.
- Missing, stale, conflicting or out-of-range inputs must not be silently treated as facts.
- Uncertainty must propagate to the advisory output.
- Every advisory should carry its rationale, evidence references, limitations and escalation path.
- The AI layer has no direct authority over steering, throttle, braking or propulsion.

## Development stages

1. Define requirements, hazards, operating boundaries and shared AI Core interfaces.
2. Gather inclusive user needs and define measurable safety, comfort, usability and cargo requirements.
3. Build software-only contracts and deterministic safety gates.
4. Create synthetic scenarios and simulation adapters.
5. Add evaluation, robustness, security, ergonomics and regression tests.
6. Consider hardware only after qualified engineering, safety, cybersecurity and legal review.

## Free AI and advanced engineering resources

See [PUI89 Free AI & Advanced Engineering Stack](docs/FREE_AI_TECH_STACK.md). Every tool, model, dataset and hosted feature requires exact licence, provenance, hardware and cost review before adoption. Free software does not guarantee free model weights, compute, datasets or commercial rights.

## Current truth

This repository contains research documentation and an initial software-only contract/safety prototype. It does not contain a functioning car, validated perception model, real-time vehicle integration, autonomous driving capability, or certified safety system. The local contract types are provisional until aligned with the canonical shared PUI89 AI Core. EasyRide features above are design goals and research requirements, not implemented or validated vehicle capabilities.
